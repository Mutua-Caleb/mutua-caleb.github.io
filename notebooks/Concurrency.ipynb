    "- Python's GIL(Global Interpreter Lock) afects CPU-bound programs running in threads, as only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. For CPU-bound tasks, use the  `multiprocessing` module, which runs processes instead of threads and avoids the GIL\n",
    "##### Why does the Python's Global interpreter Lock limit parallelism?\n",
    "- This is a mechanism in CPython that ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, even if the program has multiple threads. This design choice simplifies memory management\n",
    "- Here's a breakdown of why Python uses the GIL and the trade-offs involved\n",
    "  1. **Memory Management and Reference counting**\n",
    "        1. One of the primary reasons for the GIL is CPYthon memory management, specifically its use of **reference counting** for garbage collection. In Python, each object has an associated reference count that tracks how many references to that object exist\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "   \n",
    "  ```Python\n",
    "  a = []\n",
    "  b = a # Reference count of the list increases by 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- When the reference count of an object drops to zero, the memory associated with that object is freed\n",
    "  - Without the GIL, multiple threads accessing and modifying the reference counts simultaneously could lead to **race conditions**. Two threads could try to modify the reference count of the same object at the same time, corrupting the memory management system. \n",
    "  - The GIL ensures *thread safety* by allowing only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. This eliminates the need for locking mechanism around reference counting\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simplifying C extensions** \n",
    "Python's GIL simplifies the writing of C extensions for Python. Many external libraries, especially those written in C, expect to handle data structures without worrying about concurrency. The GIL ensures that they don't need to implement thread-safety mechanisms in their code\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Historical reason**\n",
    "When Python ws first designed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, **threading** and **multi-core** processors were not as common or as important as they are today. The GIL was a simple and effective way to handle concurrency for I/O-bound tasks, which was the primary use case at the time. Removing the GIL later, when Python was more widely used, became complicated due to backward compatibility concerns and the need to maintain efficiency \n",
    "\n",
    " #### Trade-Offs: GIL's impact on Performance\n",
    "   - *pros*\n",
    "   - **simplicity**: The GIL's makes the implementation of Cpython simpler. It avoids complex locking mechanisms that would need to be added to memory management, which would slow down single-threaded code execution\n",
    "   - **single-threaded performane**: The GIL allows Python to avoid frequent locking and unlocking in single-threaded programs, meaning that single-threaded apps run efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *cons*\n",
    "  - **CPU-bound tasks in multithreaded programs** The GIL severely limits multi-threaded performance for CPU-bound tasks (like computations). Even if you create multiple threads, only one thread can execute Python bytecode at any given time. So, multi-core systems can't fully utilize their CPUs for parallel processing in CPU-bound Python code \n",
    "  -  **I/O-bound tasks**: For I/O-bound tasks, the GIL doesn't pose much of an issue because threads spend a lot of time waiting for I/O operations (like reading from a disk or a network). During these waits, the GIL is released, allowing other threads to run. \n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Is it Possible to Remove the GIL? \n",
    "There have been several attempts to remove the GIL, such as: \n",
    "- **PyPy**: An alternative implementation of Python, which aims to remove the GIL while optimising performance. However, PyPy has not been fully successful in eliminating the GIL without performance penalties\n",
    "- **Larry Hastings Gilectomy**: A project aimed at removing the GIL in CPython. While it succeeded in eliminating the GIL, it showed significant performance degradation in single-threaded applications due to the overhead of fine-grained locking mechanisms\n"
